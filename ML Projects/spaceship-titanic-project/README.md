# TensorFlow Decision Forests - TFDF and Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA on Spaceship Titanic Dataset

Main aim is to create tree based model for predicting whether the passengers will get transported to the alternate dimension using new ML library open sourced by Google - TensorFlow Decision Forests. It was released just an year ago.

As the name suggests, this library is built on traditional machine learning algorithm - Decision Trees as its building block. Popular decision tree models that has been widely used for winning Kaggle competitions are based on ensembling techniques - Random Forests which is bagging model and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees which is boosting model. Both of these models are available on in this library.

<b>Note:</b> Please do change the directory of the datasets before running the code in each cell of the notebook.
