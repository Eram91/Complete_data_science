# Project Title
*Predicting Energy Efficiency Ratings using Machine Learning*

# Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict energy efficiency ratings (EPC) for residential buildings based on property attributes. The models were implemented and evaluated, and the results provide insights into the performance and limitations of each algorithm. The web application, built with Streamlit, allows users to interactively explore the predictions.

## Model Evaluation Results
