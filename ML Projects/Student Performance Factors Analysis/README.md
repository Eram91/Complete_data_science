## Introduction

In this project, we aim to explore the factors that influence student performance. By analyzing a dataset containing various attributes such as student demographics, family background, study habits, and test scores, we can gain valuable insights into the key determinants of academic success.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from The CSV Sheet available in the folder. It consists of 6,607  instances and 20 features. 

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
3. Open the `student_performance_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook is organized into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis. Detailed explanations and code snippets are provided to guide you through the process. Feel free to modify the notebook to suit your specific needs or explore additional research questions.

## Results

The analysis reveals several interesting findings regarding the factors influencing student performance. Some of the key insights include:

1. **Positive Correlation Between Study Hours and Exam Scores**:
   - The heatmap likely shows a strong positive correlation between the number of hours studied and exam scores. This indicates that students who dedicate more hours to studying tend to achieve higher exam scores.
2. **High Correlation Between Attendance and Exam Scores**:
   - The heatmap likely reveals a strong positive correlation between attendance and exam scores, suggesting that students with higher attendance rates tend to achieve better exam scores.

For a more detailed overview of the results, please refer to the notebook.
